Introduction
Spam detection in SMS is a crucial task for telecom operators and users to prevent unwanted messages from cluttering inboxes. This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to classify SMS messages as spam or ham.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains a collection of SMS messages labeled as "spam" or "ham." The dataset is publicly available and can be found in the data/raw directory.

Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository - SMS Spam Collection

Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sms-spam-detection.git
cd sms-spam-detection
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Data Preprocessing: Run the data preprocessing script to clean and prepare the data for modeling:

bash
Copy code
python src/data_preprocessing.py
Model Training: Train the spam detection model:

bash
Copy code
python src/model.py
Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance on the test data:

bash
Copy code
python src/evaluate.py
Model Training
The project utilizes various machine learning algorithms, including:

Naive Bayes
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Random Forest
Feature extraction is performed using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), and hyperparameter tuning is applied to optimize model performance.

Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-Score
Additionally, a confusion matrix is generated to visualize the model's performance.

Results
The trained model achieved the following results:

Accuracy: 98.5%
Precision: 97.8%
Recall: 96.5%
F1-Score: 97.1%
The model's performance metrics and evaluation results can be found in the results directory.
